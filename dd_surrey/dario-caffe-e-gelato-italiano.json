The spinach and feta filo is easily twice the size of the picture (massive!) and it was delicious. Better than some spanokopita I&apos;ve ordered from greek restaurants in the past! Couldn&apos;t finish it because it was so big, so I haven&apos;t tried all of the things we ordered yet. Partner ordered the panini and said it was really tasty- the prosciutto&apos;s saltiness was balanced by the tomato and lettuce. \n\nI ordered the caramel frappe (never tried a frappe, I usually like iced coffee) and it was a bit too sweet for me, but that&apos;s just a personal preference and if you know you like frappes, I assume you would like Dario&apos;s as well. Even though it was too sweet for my personal tastes, it was well-made (smooth and creamy, nice presentation with the caramel drizzle in the cup, and it was filled up to the top as well). My partner tried a sip and he didn&apos;t think it was too sweet, so again, it&apos;s personal preference!\nAs for the matcha frappe (partner ordered it), it was not sweet enough for him, but it was sweet enough for me. \n\nI also love that they have lactose free/dairy free options for their coffee. Will definitely order from here again! (We&apos;ve also ordered the Gelato in the past and it was delicious too!)"
