As a Chef i can tell these items are just built and added like mise en place rather than braised together such as the adobo. The egg is normally braised together too but was just a hard boiled egg. The potatoes were just boiled with no color or caramelizatiin. The chicken sisig was better but definitely not traditional but with a flare sure but not a second time. I&apos;m hesitant to order more food. Cake sure. Decent food though."
