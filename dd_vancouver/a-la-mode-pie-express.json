I ended up throwing most of it away.  I can&apos;t review the Key Lime Sliced Pie (Veg) because they gave me lemon meringue instead, which I don&apos;t like so it&apos;s also going in the bin.  The Lemon Curd Individual Tart is good, but not $30+ good.  Won&apos;t be returning, this was a complete waste of money."
