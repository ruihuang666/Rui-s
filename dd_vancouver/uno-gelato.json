The balance between the tartness of the cherries and the creamy sweetness of the gelato is just right.  Note: a few blocks up the street Casareccio has a similar gelato with bit of dark chocolate in it which is also great but they don&apos;t sell it through doordash anymore.  Uno Gelato has pre-made pints that they keep in a deep freezer so they are frozen solid and transport very well by Doordash. Casareccio scooped their ice cream into pint containers in the moment and it gets a lot meltier which maybe why they stopped including it with doordash. Our other favourite flavours are Lavazza Espresso (500ml Pint) , Roasted Hazelnut (500ml Pint) and Roasted Pistachio (500ml Pint) . All of these are very creamy and the flavour of coffee, hazelnut or pistachio are all come through strongly. We like the Yuzu Citrus Sorbetto (Vegan) (500ml Pint) too but we order it more in the summer. To finish off a meal with a satisfying dessert Uno Gelato cannot be beat."
