So tender and juicy??? Even at more expensive restaurants I kind of expect chicken to be rubbery and overcooked (or let&apos;s be real: microwaved) at this point because it&apos;s become so common, but the chicken in this QSA salad was fantastic! The avocado was also great (nice and soft, not underripe or a giant brown spot like so many places give you nowadays). Tomatoes were nice and fresh too, not squishy at all. Gotta say I&apos;m really, really impressed by the quality of this, especially for $15. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering this again, thanks CG staff!"
