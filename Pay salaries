"""
A company has an account balance of 10,000 yuan and needs to pay salaries to 20 employees.

Employee numbers range from 1 to 20. Starting from employee number 1, each employee can receive 1,000 yuan.
Performance scores (ranging from 1 to 10) are randomly generated for each employee. If an employeeâ€™s score is below 5, no salary is paid, and the next employee is considered.
If the salary fund runs out, the salary distribution stops
