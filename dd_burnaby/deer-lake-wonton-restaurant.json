For all the amazing food in this city, I&apos;ve have had a difficult time finding a General Tso&apos;s Chicken in Vancouver that hits all the same notes as what I ate growing up. After trying several places and being disappointed, Deer Lake Wonton House&apos;s General Tso&apos;s Chicken &amp; Rice was pure nostalgia! Sweet, spicy, garlicky, with just the right amount of ginger and sauce. Don&apos;t sleep on the Pork Dumpling (10 pcs ) either---super yummy filling, not-too-doughy but still tender, and a nice chili oil-based sauce too. Classic stuff---I&apos;ll definitely be ordering from here again."
