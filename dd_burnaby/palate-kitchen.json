Fruit crunch bowl is a must have. steak and eggs are the best deal in my opinion. you get so much protein and plus mushroom and potatoes that comes with the steak are amazing! Another must have item is a lamb ragu!! so delicious!!\nI order at leaset 2-3 times a week from palate kitchen and the consistency of food is perfection. They have never failed yet! (Ajay: could we please go back to original fruit crunch bowl container? it&apos;s just not the same...when you had wider bowl I could scrape the bottom dates part with the fruits but this new bowl changes the texture...)"
