There is a tiny sprinkling and I am talking maybe a half teaspoon of shredded cheese, on  top but no cheese sauce at all.\n\n  Mac and cheese is pretty simple to make, you make a white béchamel sauce with milk or cream, butter and  a small amount flour to thicken, add several cups of shredded cheese, stir until cheese is melted and well mixed, then pour it over cooked pasta. It is not difficult at all!\n\n The &quot;garlic bread&quot; is a bread &quot;finger&quot;, not a slice of bread. It measures by 1/2 and inch by 4 inches long and that is laughable!! Literally a finger sized piece of toast, not even close to being a slice of bread, let alone traditional a traditional garlic bread loaf piece! \n\n I took a photo and was literally not  &quot;allowed&quot; to attach it to this review.....that is telling! Needless to say, I will not be ordering from here again! "
