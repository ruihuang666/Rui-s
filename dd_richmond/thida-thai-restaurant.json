Pad See-Lew  and the 46. Pad Thai. I guess they got really busy after I ordered, because my estimated delivery time of less than 40 minutes turned into an hour and a half by the time it was actually delivered. Unfortunate, but these things happen. Once the food finally arrived, it wasn&apos;t as hot as usual, which was a little disappointing, and the chicken in the pad 47. Pad See-Lew was super dry and tough, and the portion a little small. If I&apos;m going to wait over double the time to recieve the food, I&apos;d hope it&apos;d be super hot and fresh and full. \nAnyway, this definitely won&apos;t stop me from ordering from here again, as they are usually very consistent with quality (it&apos;s maybe just something for the owners to consider.) Aside from the above mentioned dishes, I highly recommend the massaman curry with coconut rice."
