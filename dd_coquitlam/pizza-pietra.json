In the optional cheese section, I assumed that section was for adding extra cheese. I did not want extra cheese so I skipped it.  It turned out that I received a cheeseless pizza. So if you enjoy cheese on your pizza,  make sure you select it.  (There&apos;s a charge for it). That said, even without the cheese, my pizza was delicious!  I feel the restaurant should make that clear on the menu so there&apos;s no misunderstanding.  The dough and sauce are perfect. \n\nThe lasagna was also very tasty. Pretty decent for take out. "
