It is an untaped to-go container without a bag - so easy for a dasher to contaminate, spill, eat out of, etc. Huge red flag from that alone. Secondly, the toast is inedible (tastes very stale) and the hollandaise sauce doesn&apos;t even taste like hollandaise. It has no flavor, but the texture of custard. I&apos;ve had terrible hollandaise but at least they all tasted like it! The everything omelet tastes old and stale also, like it was made two days ago and reheated. Overall, will never eat here again, on doordash or in person. Not safe and not worth a penny. "
