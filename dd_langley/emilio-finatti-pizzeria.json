Big chain, small chain, single store operations etc etc......This place is by far the best pizza I have had period. Everything about the pizza was excellent. The crust was perfect....not too thick or too thin (it is in the thinner side), the texture and crispness of the\ncrust was the best I have ever tried (and i have had pizza with good crust). From the sauce to the toppings everything was excellent quality, and of course the taste was excellent. I had the Montreal special. I look forward to the Godfather next😁 "
